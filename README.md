# Plant-Disease-Detection-MSAI.
A Computer Vision project using CNNs (PyTorch) to classify plant diseases for sustainable agriculture. Aligned with SDG 2.
## Week 2 Update: Model Performance
The initial Custom CNN model was trained for 50 epochs on the Potato Leaf dataset.
- Training Accuracy: ~98%
- Test Accuracy: 95.42%
- Techniques: Data augmentation (flip/rotation) was used to reduce overfitting.
